            <h1>Hey üëã</h1>
            <p>
                Thanks for checking this out. This <strike>is</strike>&nbsp;<i>will be</i>&nbsp;the
                home of a free tool that helps you turn your exported <a href="https://read.cv"
                    ><span class="highlight">read.cv</span></a
                > profile data into
                <strong>your own <i>editable</i> website</strong> (in as few clicks as possible‚Ñ¢Ô∏è). Same
                profile but yours until...solar flares get us or whatever.
            </p>

            <h2>Wait...what does it do again?</h2>
            <p>Two main things:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    It extends the read.cv export code to bake in a few extra and IMO spicy
                    features:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Profile editing!</strong>
                            <p>
                                You can continue to edit and update your profile on your website
                                itself, just as you would on read.cv. No coding required.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Update sharing!</strong>
                            <p>
                                Disabled by default, but if enabled (through your admin panel)
                                updates you make to your profile will be sent to a community hub for
                                showcasing. Think the read.cv explore page ü•π.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Anytime data export!</strong>
                            <p>
                                I'm adding a button to the admin page/panel that will let you export
                                your site's content at any stage.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    It helps you deploy your site to a deployment platform (e.g. Netlify) with the
                    minimum amount of clicking around as possible.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Why build this?</h2>
            <p>
                I was an early adopter(?) of read.cv. I didn't post much over the years because I'm
                mainly a developer and never had any amazing creative projects to show off üò•. But <a
                    href="https://read.cv"><span class="highlight">read.cv</span></a
                > was probably my favorite website - both in its concept and in the reality of the thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                I would love it if I could help some people keep their profiles alive. Even better
                if some concept of the explore page lived on. More materially, I guess it could be a
                good way to connect with more people. It would be an absolute dream if this could
                somehow turn into a COMMUNITY tool üôè. <a href="mailto:mark.tomlinson3@gmail.com"
                    >Message me</a
                >&nbsp;if you know how to make that happen.
            </p>
            <p>
                Last, it can be confusing to figure out how to deploy a website, even if you have
                the code, and it would suck if people who wanted to keep their profile alive,
                couldn't.
            </p>

            <h2>But didn't the team give us an app to deploy already?</h2>
            <p>
                They did and it's great. If you just want to deploy that but aren't sure how, there
                are people in the community willing to help you, including myself, <a
                    href="mailto:mark.tomlinson3@gmail.com">so just reach out</a
                > if that's what you need.
            </p>
            <h2>What about just remaking my profile on another platform?</h2>
            <p>
                Yes, a totally good approach. The point here definitely isn't to convince you that
                deploying your own code is the right or best approach.
            </p>
            <h2>Is this another posts or read.cv replacement?</h2>
            <p>
                No, this is not a platform. You will only ever visit the site you're on right now
                one time (technically twice, if you come back to use the tool, I suppose).
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="flow faq">
            <h2>(Slightly) more (technical) questions...</h2>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            It depends a little on the platform you choose and whether you already
                            have a github account. We're talking like 4 - 5 including you uploading
                            your exported data. I mean, don't hold me to that exactly.

                        <p>
                            It would be negligent of me to build this tool without making sure the
                            documentation is as clear as possible. Expect walkthroughs as well as
                            words.

                            I'm aiming to support people who want to use Netlify, Cloudflare, and
                            Vercel, though this may change as I POC all three. For...reasons...I
                            really hesitated to include Vercel, but their platform is probably the
                            easiest to get started with so I caved.

                        How can the tool support content editing? Like, where does the data come

                            The initial data comes from the read.cv export JSON. On initial
                            deployment of your site, that data is saved into a key-value store (for
                            text) and a blob (for media). You can then edit your profile on your
                            site and that data will be saved back to those places (and read back out
                            from there).
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Fortunately, platforms like Netlify and Cloudflare have generous free
                            tiers so unless your cv is bible-length, you should be fine. But this is
                            definitely one of the tradeoffs of deploying your own site. You are
                            responsible for any costs associated with running your site. But don't
                            worry, I will provide as much information and documentation around this
                            as possible. There will also be an option to deploy the site without the
                            content editing feature, rendering this concern...no longer a concern.

                            Most definitely not. One of the very few manual steps this solution
                            requires is for you to set a password that restricts access to the admin
                            page/panel.

                            Well, all of the critical extras are installed into the app I give you
                            as a 'dependency' (i.e. external code). If the admin page/panel breaks
                            due to some crappy code I wrote, I'll be able to patch it from the
                            outside (so to speak) and you'll be good to go.
